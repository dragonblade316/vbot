# 5461 2024 Code rewrite:
This is a rewrite of the code for team VERN's rebot, Bebop.

Most of this is based on/inspired by team 6328's 2024 robot code and the Advantage kit Advanced swerve template.
6328 Mechanical Advantage was one of my favorite robots this year and they made a lot of good decisions in their code.

## docs:
Once I have finished I will probably write some simple docs explaining the structure of the project 

## Contributing:
For other 5461 team members (if any bother to read this lol) this will probably remain a largly personal project of dragonblade316. (fixing mistakes from the season)
If you have any questions about how it works let me know.

For non 5461 members: you are probably not reading this. If you are same applies, lol.
